# Big Words

A minimal, full-screen text display tool. Type anything and it fills your entire screen — perfect for presentations, classrooms, live events, or anywhere you need to show text at a distance.

## ✨ Features

- **Pixel-perfect scaling** — text always fills the screen edge-to-edge, no matter what you type
- **High-DPI support** — crisp rendering on Retina and other high-density displays
- **Auto fullscreen** — enters fullscreen on first interaction on desktop, no button needed
- **Mobile support** — tap anywhere to bring up the native keyboard on touch devices
- **Color themes** — three built-in themes, triggered by typing their name
- **Shareable URLs** — message and theme are encoded in the URL automatically
- **PWA** — installable on desktop and mobile for offline use
- **Accessible** — screen reader support via ARIA live regions and canvas labels

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MechanicalMax/big-words
cd big-words
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the provided `localhost` URL.

## ⌨️ Usage

**Desktop:** just start typing — no click needed.

**Mobile:** tap anywhere to open the native keyboard. Tap "Done" to dismiss it.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Any key | Adds a character to the display |
| `Backspace` | Removes the last character |
| `Enter` | Clears the screen |

## 🔗 Sharing

The URL updates automatically as you type — just copy and share it. The recipient lands on the same message and theme, no setup needed. The default black theme is omitted from the URL to keep links clean.

Examples:
- `bigwords.maximusshurr.com/?m=Hello`
- `bigwords.maximusshurr.com/?m=Hello&t=white`

## 🎨 Themes

Type a theme name and it switches instantly — the text clears automatically. Typing the name of the theme you're already on does nothing (no accidental clears).

| Word | Theme |
|---|---|
| `black` | White text on black (default) |
| `white` | Black text on white |
| `rainbow` | Complementary cycling colors on both text and background |

These are intentionally undocumented in the app — consider them easter eggs.
